Finding my place in this new world
# Starting from zero again

We're living in scary yet exciting times, depending on who you listen to. Some are proclaiming it's the end of the world, with AI taking over all our jobs, and we'll become just like the humans we see in Wall-E.

While for others, there's never been a best time to be alive because anything can now be built.

In this world where AI improves every month with outputs that are almost indistinguishable to humans, there's a question in all of our heads:

Where do we belong in this new world? What value can we truly provide that AI cannot?

As a marketer, my anxiety increases each day. Everywhere we go, we see how AI has replaced entire agencies with just a $200/month plan.

Why would anyone want to hire me if AI can do exactly the same job as I, but better? When it runs 24/7, while I have to sleep 8 hours a day?

These are the thoughts that are constantly running in my head. How I wish I had paid more attention to AI in its early days.

How I wish I had spent more time learning all the tools to give me a head start now, instead of struggling to learn everything from scratch.

Amidst all of this, I've been thinking of the direction of this account. I've lost my way and lost motivation, but the constant reflections finally helped me to see the light:

---

## A soft rebrand of my account

When I first created this account, I had one goal in mind:

Learn everything that I can about TEEs (which is our expertise at Automata) and share it publicly, so it becomes a journal while I become more familiar with the products we have.

And for a while, it worked.

I wrote summaries of the panels or podcasts I watched, which gave me a deeper understanding while building up a decent following on Twitter.

*I considered hitting the 1k follower mark a big deal, since I started from (almost) zero.*

But this came at the expense of my own responsibilities at work. There were many tasks to do beyond creating content on Twitter, and I struggled to balance both.

My time was split between 2 domains, while I was excelling at neither.

Soon, I started to dread writing articles on this account as I've become burnt out. It no longer excited me because I was correlating success to the metrics that I gained from these posts.

I've also realised that I failed to retain all the 'knowledge' I accumulated while writing these articles. Mainly because I was just learning all the theory, without putting it into practice by building anything.

*I could tell you why TEEs are great, but I'd fail at telling you the great applications you can build with it, because I have zero experience in that space.*

It no longer excited me, and I lost all the motivation I had to continue going.

I was struggling to get by with my work, drowning in repetitive and manual tasks that I knew AI could help me with, but I just didn't know how to integrate it.

Automata started becoming heavily AI-focused, but I still struggled with using it in my workflows.

But I've been lucky enough to take a break over the past month and just breathe. Amidst all the chaos, the model advancements, and all the over-sensationalised stories that you see on Twitter.

Once I started to experiment with AI by myself, to find problems that I have and let AI solve them for me, it finally clicked.

I no longer feared AI, but was excited to use it. The possibilities have become truly endless for me as I solved one new problem that I had for myself each day.

Even with zero coding experience, I could tell the AI what I wanted to achieve, and it would work out all the technical details on how to achieve it.

I no longer just had a topic to talk about (TEEs), but could talk about anything and everything that aligns with my mission:

Becoming irreplaceable in the age of AI, instead of struggling just to get by.

I finally had a roadmap and the clarity to build out my personal brand, which was the culmination of what I faced in these past years:

---

## The pivotal moments that finally gave me clarity

My journey has been shaped through multiple failures across different stages of my life:

---

- Using the wrong approach to study Pharmacy

The only goal I had in university was good grades. I sacrificed everything else, just to have more time to study.

But I was studying Pharmacy in the completely wrong way.

I was too focused on rote memorisation, remembering every dosage or side effect of each medicine. I drew out elaborate mind maps based on lecture notes to help me locate the information that I needed for the test.

I crammed my brain with all of these facts without bothering to link the concepts with each other.

I could score well in tests, but failed horribly when I had to apply the knowledge in practical situations. When I was asked to come up with a solution at that instant, I struggled to perform.

At points of high stress, I couldn't perform or remember anything that I had spent many months studying.

And when it came to the final pre-registration exam, I failed it because I was too burnt out from the entire pre-reg and struggled to cram 21+ chapters of facts before that.

All of my 4 years of studying had gone to waste because I measured success based on how much I could memorise, which AI can do better and much faster than me.

But I'm grateful for this wake-up call. If I had continued down this wrong mindset of learning, I would be the first to be replaced by AI.

Looking back, having a secure job was just one factor out of many that I should have considered. I was too focused on going on the 'safe, tried and tested' path, which couldn't go wrong.

If I were still working in Pharmacy, maybe I'd have been stuck in the mindset of just keeping my head down and doing the work, just to get by.

But COVID was another big turning point as it gave me the opportunity to explore other interests beyond just Pharmacy:

---

- Losing out to AI when creating SEO content

COVID was a great reset for me in my 3rd and 4th year of Pharmacy, because most lectures and assessments became purely online.

This gave me extra time, and learning about personal finance became my ultimate goal.

I wanted to understand all the concepts before I graduated and started working, because I knew I'd have no time at that point.

That was when I realised that most of the content online was too generic and didn't fit what I (as a complete beginner) wanted to know.

So that's when I made my first step to start writing online and share my journey with others. 

I first started out with a generic blog, and at the same time, was looking at how to monetise the traffic I received.

That's when I stumbled upon @SchoolofIncome's videos, and I was hooked when they showed me how to earn an income through SEO blogging.

It was something completely new to me, and I saw an opportunity to target extremely niche topics about personal finance in Singapore, especially those that weren't covered by other big sites.

I learnt about identifying underserved search terms through auto-complete and related questions, usually targeting long-tail queries that the bigger sites did not bother to cover.

And for a while, I had great results, even reaching 1 million views (especially when crypto started becoming popular).

/UPDATE WITH SS

But other sites started to catch on, and they competed with me for some of the search terms that I ranked for.

My traffic was slowly crashing, even as I pumped out more articles in an attempt to stay relevant.

I burnt out because I experienced that high during COVID, while interest in personal finance dipped significantly once the circuit breakers and other restrictions were relaxed.

And as I continued fighting with other sites with larger authority than me, I knew it was a losing battle.

SEO became a game of optimising for Google's algorithm (kind of like what most of us are doing on Twitter and LinkedIn now).

*I remember optimising for snippets just so I could rank at the highest position and give me a higher chance of getting more traffic. But the type of content that I wrote became too mechanical and boring because I wrote what I thought the algo would like, instead of what people found useful.*

But once I saw how ChatGPT could generate informational content with just one question, I pulled the plug on the entire project.

There was no way that I could outcompete a machine that writes articles faster than I could.

So I decided to go down another route in a bid to stand out:

---

- Building my personal account to 1,000 followers

I made the decision to start this account given the shift towards personal accounts, away from brand accounts.

With a brand account, I felt restricted in what I could post, as any wrong post could ruin its reputation.

*While a personal account gave me more freedom in what I could say and do.*

While writing long-form TEE summaries did give me some traction, I was again looking at the wrong metric for success.

I thought that followers and appealing to the 'right' audience were the right way to grow my account. I was focused on getting noticed by founders and others who talked about TEEs and getting into that 'Inner Circle'.

I obsessed over follower counts and constantly celebrated them, when I should have followed @emilios_eth's advice on completely ignoring these milestones.

/ADD EMILIOS

Once again, I burnt out because my account became more of a performance that others (and even myself) were slowly losing interest in.

And it didn't help that I faced another problem at work

---

- Struggling with integrating AI into my workflows

Automata shifted towards an AI-first company, where everything that can be done with AI, should be done with AI.

I was completely lost because I just saw ChatGPT as an advanced search engine with no way of using it effectively in my workflows.

I was frustrated after having to paste the same context file that I had into the same chat, so that ChatGPT could remember the task I wanted to complete.

When vibe coding became more popular, we were asked to build cool websites that could showcase our products in an engaging way, and I struggled even more.

My creative juices were constantly lacking and I just couldn't seem to generate any interesting ideas.

I did make some breakthroughs, but it didn't gain the traction I was hoping for.

At the same time, I was tasked with growing the @1rpc_ai brand by:

- Sharing cool things you could do with the models
- Generating visually stunning images that would get views

I was so overwhelmed because I didn't know where to start. All the new benchmarks, model updates, and influencer posts made me feel extremely inferior in what I know.

I had zero ideas on how to create compelling content with 1RPC, and was stuck in a rut.

So I'm extremely grateful for this break that gave me more clarity:

---

- Building my Digital Brain

I count myself lucky because I've been away on hospitalisation leave for a month now. During this recovery phase, I saw how LLMs continue to improve their capabilities and become better with every update.

But at the same time, I finally had the time to experiment. To fail without major repercussions to my work, and have the time to reflect and iterate.

As I shared in the Digital Brain article, it all finally clicked after I watched 2 videos about using Claude Code for automations, even without having to code anything.

/UPDATE LINK

Finally, on 5 Feb, I decided to take the plunge and start building out a system that automates my life.

And in the past 2 weeks, I've been adding more features to this system in an attempt to outsource all the tasks I hated to Claude.

I would have never learned so effectively if I continued to sit and wait for the perfect course or prompt to drop into my lap.

I realised that the only way to learn is by doing, failing, and reflecting.

There's only so much theory that can prepare you for the real world, and you need skin in the game to apply the knowledge (just like in pharmacy too).

These 2 weeks have helped me build a stronger understanding of AI than in the past 2 years, and I'm grateful for this opportunity to not get left behind.

---

## Ignore all the noise about AI

If you feel like you're being left behind in this crazy AI age, don't be.

Over-sensationalised news is everywhere. Everyone claims they can replace entire departments with just Claude Code.

The fear on Twitter and LinkedIn is crazy, and it seems like the end of the world is near.

You'll feel pressured (just like I did) to come up with some amazing workflow that runs your entire life for you with minimal input.

But that's not always the best system for you.

You're just trying to copy someone else's systems without understanding how it works, and how you can apply them to your Personal Context.

So here's the effective way of improving your relationship with AI:

- Find a soul-sucking, repetitive task that you hate doing
- Frame the problem to your LLM, describing in detail what you face and the outcome that you want to achieve
- Let Claude decide on the best approach to solve the problem
- Iterate if the output is not desired

No matter how small your feature is, I still see it as a win if you buy back some time by outsourcing menial tasks to AI.

Time is the only scarce resource that we can never earn back, and AI gives us the opportunity to get back more of it.

Don't feel inferior because what you build is not 'cool' or 'useful', but continue iterating and building a system that works for you.

## Become irreplaceable in the age of AI

As a marketer myself, I've seen countless opinions on how marketing would either thrive or die with AI.

But I believe that AI is best used as both a:

- Multiplier of your current efforts
- Thought partner that challenges your assumptions

In the past, I would throw a half-finished outline to ChatGPT and pray that it generates something usable for me to publish.

But now, I've realised that AI should be used to go deeper into the topic. It should not write for me, but write with me and build depth.

All while doing the boring tasks that I hate.

You don't need to become an expert to use AI.

All you need is to find one problem that you can solve.

And my goal is to help you find the problems in your life that are easily solvable by AI.

I want to equip you with the skills to build systems that work for you, and buy back your time to do higher ROI tasks.

Thank you for reading all the way, and I look forward to walking with you on this journey to become an Irreplaceable Creator that stands out from the sea of noise.

Every week, I show overwhelmed marketers how to use AI to buy back their time.

Even as non-coders, you can build practical systems that automate tedious tasks that work for your specific context.

Who content is for
- What you help with
- Inject contrarian belief if possible
- Set trajectory for the relationship with audience

I've struggled with being a TEE account. I was writing about TEEs, but it didn't excite me because I wasn't building anything.

All I did was to summarise the learnings from panels or podcasts I watched.

But I soon realised that 

And all the learnings about 

Being lost after severely burning out and totally losing the motivation

What triggered this decision?
Hospitalisation

# Video 1: My introduction - why I'm building in public now

## Core Idea

First video in Caleb Ralston's "First 3 Videos" framework - an introduction video that establishes who I am, why I'm creating content now, and what audience can expect going forward.

## Caleb Ralston Framework: Video 1 (Introduction)

### Purpose
Establish who you are and why audience should care; set expectations for future content; pair your story with lessons for audience benefit.

### Structure

**1. Why are you making content now? Why this purpose? Why now?** (Frame-setting)
- What triggered the decision to build in public
- Why this specific moment in your journey
- What changed that made you ready to share

**2. 3-5 pivotal career/life moments** (not a resume dump)
- Turning points that shaped your thinking
- Critical decisions or experiences
- Moments where everything changed perspective

**3. Pair each moment with one clear, valuable lesson**
- Lesson must address viewer pain/goals/confusion/clarity-seeking
- Make it actionable and immediately useful
- Focus on audience benefit, not just your accomplishment

**4. Close with what audience should expect**
- Who content is for
- What you help with
- Inject contrarian belief if possible
- Set trajectory for the relationship with audience

### Key Distinction

**This video is ABOUT you, but it is FOR your audience.**

Lessons must speak to their needs, not just showcase your accomplishments. Not a brag reel or resume dump - it's pivotal moments paired with actionable lessons.

### Example Pivotal Moments (Brainstorm)

1. **Pharmacy career** → Realising 4 years of study led to replaceability
   - Lesson: Specialisation without differentiation = commodity

2. **Discovering Automata/Web3** → Moving from traditional pharma to crypto/tech
   - Lesson: Career pivots require courage to start from zero

3. **Struggling with AI workflows** → Everyone seemed expert overnight
   - Lesson: Comparison paralysis prevents experimentation

4. **Building digital-brain system** → Creating tools that compound knowledge
   - Lesson: Systems > heroic effort for sustainable productivity

5. **Decision to build in public** → Overcoming fear of looking stupid
   - Lesson: Authenticity beats polish when building trust

### Contrarian Belief to Inject

"In the AI era, **judgment beats specialisation**. Technical skills become commodities - your irreplaceable value is in knowing which problems to solve and how to orchestrate tools to solve them."

OR

"Most people hide their learning journey until they're 'experts.' But **building in public accelerates learning** because accountability and feedback create faster iteration loops than private study ever could."

## Brand Voice Reminder

**nuhgid Voice:**
- **Tone:** Authentic over polished. Conversational over formal.
- **Positioning:** Human voice for work content (not corporate)
- **Approach:** Personal insights, behind-the-scenes, learning journey
- **Technical:** Depth with accessibility, no jargon walls
- **Stakes:** Human stakes over corporate stakes
- **Language:** British English (-ise, -our, -re)

**Anti-AI Constraints:**
- No "isn't X, it's Y" patterns
- No fake enthusiasm or superlatives
- No generic inspiration ("game-changing", "revolutionary")
- Write like you talk to a peer, not like a motivational poster

## Related Published Articles

**These published articles connect with your idea:**

1. **[The Irreplaceable Manifesto](digital-brain/Content_Archive/nuhgid/articles/20260210_The_Irreplaceable_Manifesto/20260210_The_Irreplaceable_Manifesto.md)** - Published 2026-02-10
   - Connection: Both explore identity and positioning in the AI era. This introduction video sets up WHY you're sharing your journey; the manifesto delivers the WHAT (four-layer framework for irreplaceability)

## Thinking Questions

**Before outlining, consider:**

1. **Clarity:** What's the single sentence that captures why you're building in public NOW (not 6 months ago, not 6 months from now)?

2. **Differentiation:** What makes your learning journey different from the thousand other "I'm learning AI" accounts?

3. **Audience:** Who specifically needs to hear "it's okay to start from zero even when everyone seems expert"?

4. **Voice:** Does this feel like nuhgid (authentic, conversational, human stakes) or generic LinkedIn inspiration?

5. **Value:** If someone watches this introduction, what specific mindset shift or actionable insight do they walk away with?

6. **Pivotal Moments:** Which 3-5 moments genuinely changed your trajectory (not just resume bullet points)?

7. **Lessons:** For each moment, what's the ONE lesson that would have changed everything if you'd learned it earlier?

8. **Credibility:** What have you actually built/done that gives you permission to teach these lessons?

9. **Authenticity Test:** Would you send this video to someone whose opinion you deeply respect, or would you be embarrassed?

10. **Stakes:** Why does this matter to YOU personally, beyond career/business outcomes?

## Next Steps

- Brainstorm your actual 3-5 pivotal moments with real specificity
- For each moment, identify the valuable lesson for audience
- Clarify your contrarian belief (what do you genuinely believe that most in your space disagree with?)
- Draft the "why now" answer (what changed that made this the right time?)
- Move to outlining using `/article-outline` when ready to structure
- Consider filming format (talking head, b-roll, scripted vs casual)

## Notes

- This is VIDEO content, not article - script for camera, not written piece
- Caleb's example: His introduction established credibility through pivotal moments while immediately injecting "optimize for trust, not virality" belief
- Length doesn't matter as much as maintaining high value per minute
- The goal: after watching, viewer should understand who you are, why they should care, and what to expect from future content
- Remember: introduction establishes foundation for all future videos
