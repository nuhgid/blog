Claude Code runs 85% of my life (how I built a Digital Brain)
I built my Digital Brain with Claude Code in 8 days (how you can do it too)


# Claude automates 85% of my life (how I built a Digital Brain in 8 days)

Claude Code completely changed how I work. Even with zero coding experience, I've built out a system that organises my entire life into one GitHub repo.

Imagine a system that acts like a living replica of your brain, except that it forms connections quickly between new entries, and knows exactly what you want, when you need it.

I was skeptical of how AI could ever be integrated into my workflows.

I continued generating average outputs from ChatGPT and other models, because I didn't give it enough context.

While I found it a chore to copy and paste the exact same context each time I needed an output, because of the LLM's limited context window.

But what if you could organise your files in a smarter way, that the LLM could produce context-rich outputs while you write requests in natural language?

In the past 8 days, I've built out a Digital Brain that runs almost every aspect of my life:
- Captures text from articles or YouTube videos and organises them into thought leaders whom I follow (so I can reference it later)
- Uses brand guidelines for my personal and brand (Automata) account to draft tweets
- Track pain point insights I gained from my DMs
- Archives tweets I posted with @typefully to reference in the future
- Generates To-Dos that are viewable with Google Tasks
- Extracts all of my expenses from my credit card statements to build out a comprehensive expense tracker
- Uses 40+ Claude skills to automate key functions and roles from above

![[Pasted image 20260211121343.png]]

I'm still in the process of learning and refining my system, but here's how you can build one system for yourself (even with zero coding experience like me):

---
## The posts that finally made AI click for me

I previously shared my struggles with AI, where I couldn't see how it could possibly fit into my workflows.

Back then, I saw AI as just a platform where I:

- Wrote a simple one-liner prompt to achieve a task I wanted to complete
- Get frustrated with the output because of the lack of context
- Search for some other document in my Google Drive to give it more context
- Get a decent output that I could use

The same cycle repeated itself over and over again. Every time I wanted to use an LLM, I had to find the right context to give it, which wasted more time.

That's the limitations of the current general-purpose chats with a limited context window:

Once the window runs out, your chat starts afresh, and you have to reshare the same context to get it up to speed with the task at hand.

*It's just like how we train an intern over 3 months, and we have to start afresh training and dumping the same context to a new intern, only to repeat the same cycle over and over again.*

Maybe it's great for the everyday user who just wants a simple answer from a search query. 

But there are many shortcomings if we want to fully integrate AI into our workflows, where the system can understand what context to use and where to apply it.

But after reading and watching more resources, these resources made me finally realise how I could build a highly effective system for myself to do almost any task I want:

---

- *Dan Koe's systemise your life with AI course*

I've been reading @thedankoe's posts even before he blew up on Twitter, and one key item he's been teaching is audience is how AI performs best when you let it run a system.

Every process that you do each day can be broken down into various tasks, and AI helps you to do them faster.

So ultimately, you still need to teach AI how you perform a certain task your way, or it'll give out something that's too generic.

*You could think of the AI as being your employee where you need to give it detailed instructions or SOPs before it gets work done.*

Through the videos in this [course](https://letters.thedankoe.com/p/mini-course-how-i-systemize-my-life), I saw how powerful an LLM can be when it uses your context:

Kortex (his software) allowed him to tag different documents that included and then reference them to build out an exceptional prompt that can consistently generate good tweets or even newsletters.

![[Pasted image 20260212110227.png]]

*Because of the context he shared, it gives the LLM direction on what the ideal output should be, instead of coming up with an average output that comes from a one-liner prompt.*

His system followed a Notion-style structure where you can tag different files in the chat to use them as context for the LLM to give the output.

I did try this with various markdown files as the context in Gemini, but it was still troublesome having to find every file to use.

![[Pasted image 20260212105407.png]]

But what if we could create a system that knows exactly what action you want at any time, because it knows the context of how you wanted it to be built?

And even better, there's no vendor lock-in so you could export all your files immediately to any platform and have your LLM access it:

---

- *Teresa Torres' videos on running her life on Claude Code*

It all finally clicked for me when I saw how @ttorres was running her entire life with just:

- Obsidian (for writing)
- Terminal (to access Claude Code)

*I was a huge Notion fan previously, but I'm now starting to realise how more versatile Obsidian is just by being natively in Markdown.*

She shared her demo in both @petergyang's and @clairevo's podcasts, and it gave me a big revelation on how I could use Claude Code to perform day-to-day tasks, all within the Terminal (it's possible to use IDEs like VS Code or Cursor too).

[https://x.com/petergyang/status/2002753608711090426](https://x.com/petergyang/status/2002753608711090426)

[https://x.com/clairevo/status/2013314105185062913](https://x.com/clairevo/status/2013314105185062913)

Almost any task could be done with just these 2 platforms, and she shared how she:

- Searches and summarises research papers scanned from arXiv and Google Scholar
- SEO keyword research
- Brainstorming ideas for articles

These were the key takeaways I had after watching both videos:

- Build a strong index (brain.md) so Claude can query the right files that are relevant to a certain task
- Create a granular context library so Claude doesn't need to read through the entire CLAUDE.md file to find a simple task (which wastes a lot of tokens)
- Reflect together with Claude on how it can further improve the workflow in an iterative style

The goal is to build a system where you could literally type a few words, and Claude already knows what you want (because of all the context you gave it previously).

*Because of all the context that's stored within the various files, Claude can query those that it thinks are relevant to a certain task to give you a context-rich output.*

I highly recommend watching this video in its entirety to see how different workflows could be done in just Claude Code alone.

*These were before Claude Skills became popular, and it's even easier to create her Digital Brain now.*

I watched Carl Vellotti's [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nthc76rSl8) with Aakash Gupta, who shared a similar concept of running any task in the IDE using Claude Code.

He shared how he could generate a PRD for a certain idea, and Claude provided a context-rich output which took reference from:

- Branding guidelines
- Business context
- Example PRDs

![[Pasted image 20260212112427.png]]

These posts completely changed my perspective on how I could use AI and even Claude Code as a non-coder, and here's how I applied them into building out my own system:

---

## The ingredients that I used

At the core of this system is the Markdown file.

LLMs don't read text files or blog posts the same way as we do. Because of the simple and readable format of a Markdown file, LLMs can process text more efficiently without heavy token usage (which is what we want).

If you search for LLM-friendly documentation like the ones on Mintlify, you will see the 'Copy as Markdown' option that lets you paste it directly into an LLM for it to understand the context better.

![[Pasted image 20260211174238.png]]

So to create a Digital Brain system that uses Claude Code, you have to be comfortable writing in Markdown.

I've had experience creating documentation for Automata and our other products using Markdown, so it's not something that's foreign to me:

---

- Obsidian for writing

The best software I've found is Obsidian, which allows me to write natively in Markdown.

*It was a relief that I used Notion since I could easily import all my files directly to Obsidian.*

Now, my Obsidian file is full of different .md files that give context to the AI, as well as all the tasks that I want to complete.

The main function I use Obsidian for is writing, just like this article. I like the split view, which allows me to put the outline (which I generated with my Digital Brain) alongside my draft, so I can refer to it at any time when I'm stuck.

![[Pasted image 20260211143745.png]]

One reason why I liked Notion was the ability to easily sync my progress between my desktop and phone (since I take a while to travel to work).

Obsidian's sync feature costs an extra $4/month, which I wasn't keen on spending while learning the ropes of building my system.

So I settled for this method instead:

---

- GitHub

*I only find this step necessary if you're looking to sync between different devices. If you're just working on one device, then you could skip it.*

Obsidian has an iCloud Drive sync capability (which is free when you store the .md files inside), but it has been wonky when I switched between devices.

I knew that Obsidian's sync was paid, and while searching on YouTube, I found another solution for syncing between platforms:

Using GitHub as the 'main source of truth'.

Obsidian has a GitHub plugin where I could sync my files directly with the GitHub repo.

![[Pasted image 20260211144656.png]]



Please remember to set this as private, or all of your data will be accessible to anyone.

*I'm grateful for my vibe coding experiences that made me somewhat familiar with GitHub, so I wouldn't have stumbled at this step.*

That way, my Obsidian vault will reflect the exact same structure as my GitHub repo.

![[Pasted image 20260211174339.png]]

And the reason why I'm doing this is that I can't use Claude Code on Obsidian (for now):

---

- VS Code + Claude Code extension
I've never downloaded VS Code in my life because of how complex the platform seemed to be.

But once I was encouraged to run Claude Code on my Mac for other vibe coding projects, it has become something I use every day.

VS Code lets you run Claude directly inside with the extension.

![[Pasted image 20260211144018.png]]

As a non-coder, I'm using the chatbox but it's perfectly fine to use the Terminal to do up your chats.

![[Pasted image 20260212113048.png]]

Another part of Claude Code that I just learnt about was Skills, which are meant to replace agents as shared by Barry Zhang and Mahesh Murag from Anthropic.

[https://x.com/barry_zyj/status/1978860549837299948](https://x.com/barry_zyj/status/1978860549837299948)

I've been building out Skills to automate the boring tasks that take me ages to complete, and all I need is to invoke a slash command (inspired by Teresa Torres' /today command).

![[Pasted image 20260211163044.png]]

*Claude Skills have not been invoked reliably by using natural language, so I decided to configure them as slash commands instead (which are more reliable).*

I'll be sharing how I built out these skills in another post, but I feel it's worth learning and iterating on how to build one out (instead of using a preset one).

*Claude's preset skill builder is comprehensive enough so you could state the task you want to complete and they'll help you out.*

---

## How I built out the system
I had a lot of files that I (thankfully) compiled in Notion, which gave me a good head start on building out my brain.

![[Pasted image 20260212113733.png]]

This could be a tedious portion of it, depending on where you store all of your documents. 

*I believe it's possible to import Word or Google doc files inside via a MCP, though you may need to build that out or experiment with the MCPs out there (I haven't touched that yet).*

So I created a GitHub repo to store all 5,050+ (and counting) files that I gathered from different sources, and used this file architecture inspired by Teresa Torres:

- Content Archive: A list of all of the published posts by Automata and my personal account, so I can use pattern recognition to surface new insights or interlink between ideas
- Context: The key source of information that gets linked through Skills. When I want to capture an idea for an article, the Skill immediately references my branding_guidelines.md to add more context about the idea based on my thought process
- Readwise: I'm using @readwise to sync my swipe files and to also highlight key points in long-form articles that I read. It's a paid subscription and all of my highlights are stored here that I can use for future articles as quotes
- Tasks: The working layer, articles are my busiest where I go through the entire flow from idea → outlining → writing → done, before moving over to the Content Archive (sort of my mini Kanban)
- Writing: A .md tracker of all the tasks that I'm doing

![[Pasted image 20260211163654.png]]

The key file inside this repo is the brain_index.md file, which routes queries to the appropriate context.

![[Pasted image 20260211164641.png]]

This helps to save tokens, and there's likely not one perfect system. I built mine out through trial and error, where if the output is not what I'd expect:

I'd let Claude know and ask it to adapt the brain_index.md file which adapts to my new commands.

*It will take time to iterate, and I doubt it's possible to get everything working immediately.*

I try to load up as much information in the Context and Content_Archive folders, which are all stored in .md files.

An example of context was how I built out libraries that included all of the transcripts and newsletters by the thought leaders and other creators that I follow.


![[Pasted image 20260211164933.png]]

At any time, I could ask Claude about how Alex Hormozi teaches me how to create an offer, and Claude will look inside that file.

![[Pasted image 20260211165455.png]]

I've also built out multiple workflows to complete certain tasks that I hate doing.

The first task I wanted to completely eradicate was summarising YouTube transcripts.

My old process involved:

- Copying the YouTube URL
- Find a YouTube to Transcript tool
- Copy the generated transcript into ChatGPT
- Use my summariser prompt to summarise it
- Read through the summary

There are times when I forget about a certain transcript, and I have to go through the entire process again, which wastes even more time.

Now, I've built a youtube-learnings skill that does both:
- Getting the transcript from a YouTube URL 
- Summarising using my prompt
- Adding more context to the thought leader's index file

All I need is to type this command,

![[Pasted image 20260211170102.png]]

and a transcript and summary will be generated in the appropriate folder, which I could query at any time.

![[Pasted image 20260211174604.png]]

*A huge amount of time is saved doing the same repetitive tasks over and over again.*

And I'm sure that you have the same tasks in your workflow. The ones you hate that you could outsource and delegate to Claude to complete for you.

So if I were to break down my entire Digital Brain into repeatable steps, it would look something like this process:

- Clone the repo in VS Code
- Initial commit: Add as many .md files with all your relevant context and get Claude to organise them into relevant folders (with approval)
- Use Claude Code to make changes to the files or create Skills
- Commit changes to GitHub
- Sync the changes to Obsidian
- Make changes on Obsidian and sync back
- Pull changes from GitHub with Claude Code

Its looks complicated on paper, but I've streamlined many tasks with this system (especially those that are easily automated).

But these 8 days have not been the smoothest, and I encountered many challenges while building it out:

---

## The lessons I learned

I stayed up till 3 or even 4am in the first few days trying to get everything to work.

Many things were failing, especially when I tried to integrate different APIs into the system.

These are some of the key takeaways that I had while building out this system:

---

- *Teach AI through reflection*

The unique part of this Claude Code-Obsidian setup is how Claude can continuously learn about how you work through our interactions.

Every single interaction will provide new insights or even preferences on what I like, such as:

- Generating titles in sentence case
- Using the YYYYMMDD format when naming files
- Tagging everything using the YAML format to better visualise them on Obsidian

Based on Teresa's video, she mentioned how she asks Claude "What did you learn about me that should go in a context file?"

Claude will internalise these preferences you have (mine created a preference.md file), so that it can be referenced in the future to know how to better serve you.

*I developed a /reflect skill that I invoke before the end of the day so as to update Claude's profile about me*

---

- *Adapt from others instead of copying*

When something works for someone, it doesn't mean that it'll work for you.

Teresa's Digital Brain had 4 main system files:

- /Context
- /Tasks
- /Journal
- /Research

If I had strictly followed her folder architecture, I would have built something that wasn't to my liking, because it didn't fit my needs.

Teresa mentioned in her podcast that "how we manage tasks is so idiosyncratic that you should build for yourself".

So I've done exactly that and took the best bits that work for me from her system, and adapted it to my use case:

- Added the Learnings folder so I can build out a Library of Experts I can reference at any time
- Splitting Context and Tasks into my work and personal domains
- Building out Skills with automation workflows

*The perfect system doesn't exist out there to build your Digital Brain. Once you understand this (like I finally have), then you'll realise that the best way is to build it out for yourself.*

---

- *Break down tasks into Atomic Skills*

This was a painful lesson for me, because I had to reshape how I structured all my Skills (and wasted a lot of time in the process).

I had 2 different workflows that required getting a YouTube transcript:

- Summarising that script and then adding both the transcript and summary to the Learnings folder
- Getting the transcript alone just to create prompts (so I get an expert's view that I can adapt into a prompt)

When I called the YouTube transcript skill, Claude got confused and didn't know which skill I was referring to.

My skills code became bloated where each skill repeated the same tasks e.g. getting the transcript from the YouTube video.

If I wanted to make any changes to the entire workflow, I had to go through every different skill and modify it, which was a painful process.

So what I learned is to avoid creating monolithic skills where it manages the entire workflow.

Instead, I should have done this:

- Break down each monolithic skill into atomic components
- Create orchestrator skills that use each Atomic Skill to create a workflow

![[Pasted image 20260211170406.png]]

I first saw the term orchestrator skill in @dabit3's post below, which I find it extremely applicable in this context.

[https://x.com/dabit3/status/2020970650916225525](https://x.com/dabit3/status/2020970650916225525)

This is similar to something that we do every day (which I'm struggling with now post-surgery):

Walking is an orchestrator skill that coordinates between multiple atomic skills:

- Balance
- Rhythm
- Muscle contraction
- Joint flexion

These same skills can be used for running or standing (different orchestrator skills).

So I've learnt when writing a skill for Claude, I would think through if it's an atomic or orchestrator skill.

If it's an orchestrator, I have to break it apart into the atomic skills, so that I can plug and play them when they're required in future workflows that I want to build.

![[Pasted image 20260212101735.png]]

## Build your system your way

> The goal of using Claude Code is to integrate your entire workflow into one repository that becomes a living replica of your mind

As shared by Teresa Torres, the ultimate goal is to type commands in your own style.

Because AI has enough relevant context about you, it is able to decipher what you want and perform the required tasks.

Here's an example of how I brain-dumped certain ideas after a shower,

![[Pasted image 20260211145531.png]]

and this was the result.

![[Pasted image 20260211150101.png]]

*Not the most perfect of examples since it failed to understand what I was trying to say.*

But even then, it's a good sign to refine my skill.md so that I don't have to teach it again in future.

![[Pasted image 20260211150305.png]]

The system won't be perfect right from the start. Even when you give as much context as possible to the AI, I doubt that you can one-shot your Digital Brain.

Instead, look to iterate and constantly reflect on the result that Claude gives you.

If it's not up to standard, let Claude know what worked and what didn't.

Based on your feedback, it will adapt and change the Skill.md file so that it works more effectively.

![[Pasted image 20260212103821.png]]

---

## It's time to build yours

In just 8 days and barely any coding experience, I've built out a system that runs almost all of my life.

![[Pasted image 20260213165630.png]]

I'm basically stuck in either VS Code or Obsidian to improve the file structure or write articles, respectively.

Whenever there's a new process that I want to do, I'll look at how it can be integrated into Claude Code through APIs, including:

- Google Tasks
- Typefully
- Notion
- MonkeyType (to train my typing)
- Google Account

There's no perfect system, and I'm sure mine will change completely over the next few months.

But the only thing I can recommend right now is to start doing.

I never knew this would be possible until I tried (and failed many times in the first few days).

And if the only thing that's holding you back is because you're scared of doing it wrong (like I was), there's really no excuse. The only way we can truly learn is by failing, and not watching another 3-hour Claude Code masterclass on YouTube.

Before you become replaceable, it's time to take action now.
