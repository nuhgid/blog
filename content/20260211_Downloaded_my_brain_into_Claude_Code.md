Claude Code runs 85% of my life (how I built a Digital Brain)
I built my Digital Brain with Claude Code in 8 days (how you can do it too)


# Claude automates 85% of my life (how I built a Digital Brain in 8 days)

Claude Code completely changed how I work. Even with zero coding experience, I've built out a system that organises my entire life into one GitHub repo.

Imagine a system that acts like a living replica of your brain, except that it forms connections quickly between new entries, and knows exactly what you want, when you need it.

I was skeptical of how AI could ever be integrated into my workflows.

I continued generating average outputs from ChatGPT and other models, because I didn't give it enough context.

While I found it a chore to copy and paste the exact same context each time I needed an output, because of the LLM's limited context window.

But what if you could organise your files in a smarter way, that the LLM could produce context-rich outputs while you write requests in natural language?

In the past 8 days, I've built out a Digital Brain that runs almost every aspect of my life:
- Captures text from articles or YouTube videos and organises them into thought leaders whom I follow (so I can reference it later)
- Uses brand guidelines for my personal and brand (Automata) account to draft tweets
- Track pain point insights I gained from my DMs
- Archives tweets I posted with @typefully to reference in the future
- Generates To-Dos that are viewable with Google Tasks
- Extracts all of my expenses from my credit card statements to build out a comprehensive expense tracker
- Uses 40+ Claude skills to automate key functions and roles from above

![[Pasted image 20260211121343.png]]

I'm still in the process of learning and refining my system, but here's how you can build one system for yourself (even with zero coding experience like me):

---
## The posts that finally made AI click for me

I previously shared my struggles with AI, where I couldn't see how it could possibly fit into my workflows.

Back then, I saw AI as just a platform where I:

- Wrote a simple one-liner prompt to achieve a task I wanted to complete
- Get frustrated with the output because of the lack of context
- Search for some other document in my Google Drive to give it more context
- Get a decent output that I could use

The same cycle repeated itself over and over again. Every time I wanted to use an LLM, I had to find the right context to give it, which wasted more time.

That's the limitations of the current general-purpose chats with a limited context window:

Once the window runs out, your chat starts afresh, and you have to reshare the same context to get it up to speed with the task at hand.

*It's just like how we train an intern over 3 months, and we have to start afresh training and dumping the same context to a new intern, only to repeat the same cycle over and over again.*

Maybe it's great for the everyday user who just wants a simple answer from a search query. 

But there are many shortcomings if we want to fully integrate AI into our workflows, where the system can understand what context to use and where to apply it.

But after reading and watching more resources, these resources made me finally realise how I could build a highly effective system for myself to do almost any task I want:

---

- *Dan Koe's systemise your life with AI course*

I've been reading @thedankoe's posts even before he blew up on Twitter, and one key item he's been teaching is audience is how AI performs best when you let it run a system.

Every process that you do each day can be broken down into various tasks, and AI helps you to do them faster.

So ultimately, you still need to teach AI how you perform a certain task your way, or it'll give out something that's too generic.

*You could think of the AI as being your employee where you need to give it detailed instructions or SOPs before it gets work done.*

Through the videos in this [course](https://letters.thedankoe.com/p/mini-course-how-i-systemize-my-life), I saw how powerful an LLM can be when it uses your context:

Kortex (his software) allowed him to tag different documents that included and then reference them to build out an exceptional prompt that can consistently generate good tweets or even newsletters.

![[Pasted image 20260212110227.png]]

*Because of the context he shared, it gives the LLM direction on what the ideal output should be, instead of coming up with an average output that comes from a one-liner prompt.*

His system followed a Notion-style structure where you can tag different files in the chat to use them as context for the LLM to give the output.

I did try this with various markdown files as the context in Gemini, but it was still troublesome having to find every file to use.

![[Pasted image 20260212105407.png]]

But what if we could create a system that knows exactly what action you want at any time, because it knows the context of how you wanted it to be built?

And even better, there's no vendor lock-in so you could export all your files immediately to any platform and have your LLM access it:

---

- *Teresa Torres' videos on running her life on Claude Code*

It all finally clicked for me when I saw how @ttorres was running her entire life with just:

- Obsidian (for writing)
- Terminal (to access Claude Code)

*I was a huge Notion fan previously, but I'm now starting to realise how more versatile Obsidian is just by being natively in Markdown.*

She shared her demo in both @petergyang's and @clairevo's podcasts, and it gave me a big revelation on how I could use Claude Code to perform day-to-day tasks, all within the Terminal (it's possible to use IDEs like VS Code or Cursor too).

[https://x.com/petergyang/status/2002753608711090426](https://x.com/petergyang/status/2002753608711090426)

[https://x.com/clairevo/status/2013314105185062913](https://x.com/clairevo/status/2013314105185062913)

Almost any task could be done with just these 2 platforms, and she shared how she:

- Searches and summarises research papers scanned from arXiv and Google Scholar
- SEO keyword research
- Brainstorming ideas for articles

These were the key takeaways I had after watching both videos:

- Build a strong index (brain.md) so Claude can query the right files that are relevant to a certain task
- Create a granular context library so Claude doesn't need to read through the entire CLAUDE.md file to find a simple task (which wastes a lot of tokens)
- Reflect together with Claude on how it can further improve the workflow in an iterative style

The goal is to build a system where you could literally type a few words, and Claude already knows what you want (because of all the context you gave it previously).

*Because of all the context that's stored within the various files, Claude can query those that it thinks are relevant to a certain task to give you a context-rich output.*

I highly recommend watching this video in its entirety to see how different workflows could be done in just Claude Code alone.

*These were before Claude Skills became popular, and it's even easier to create her Digital Brain now.*

I watched Carl Vellotti's [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nthc76rSl8) with Aakash Gupta, who shared a similar concept of running any task in the IDE using Claude Code.

He shared how he could generate a PRD for a certain idea, and Claude provided a context-rich output which took reference from:

- Branding guidelines
- Business context
- Example PRDs

![[Pasted image 20260212112427.png]]

These posts completely changed my perspective on how I could use AI and even Claude Code as a non-coder, and here's how I applied them into building out my own system:

---

## The ingredients that I used

At the core of this system is the Markdown file.

LLMs don't read text files or blog posts the same way as we do. Because of the simple and readable format of a Markdown file, LLMs can process text more efficiently without heavy token usage (which is what we want).

If you search for LLM-friendly documentation like the ones on Mintlify, you will see the 'Copy as Markdown' option that lets you paste it directly into an LLM for it to understand the context better.

![[Pasted image 20260211174238.png]]

So to create a Digital Brain system that uses Claude Code, you have to be comfortable writing in Markdown.

I've had experience creating documentation for Automata and our other products using Markdown, so it's not something that's foreign to me:

---

- Obsidian for writing

The best software I've found is Obsidian, which allows me to write natively in Markdown.

*It was a relief that I used Notion since I could easily import all my files directly to Obsidian.*

Now, my Obsidian file is full of different .md files that give context to the AI, as well as all the tasks that I want to complete.

The main function I use Obsidian for is writing, just like this article. I like the split view, which allows me to put the outline (which I generated with my Digital Brain) alongside my draft, so I can refer to it at any time when I'm stuck.

![[Pasted image 20260211143745.png]]

One reason why I liked Notion was the ability to easily sync my progress between my desktop and phone (since I take a while to travel to work).

Obsidian's sync feature costs an extra $4/month, which I wasn't keen on spending while learning the ropes of building my system.

So I settled for this method instead:

---

- GitHub

*I only find this step necessary if you're looking to sync between different devices. If you're just working on one device, then you could skip it.*

Obsidian has an iCloud Drive sync capability (which is free when you store the .md files inside), but it has been wonky when I switched between devices.

I knew that Obsidian's sync was paid, and while searching on YouTube, I found another solution for syncing between platforms:

Using GitHub as the 'main source of truth'.

Obsidian has a GitHub plugin where I could sync my files directly with the GitHub repo.

![[Pasted image 20260211144656.png]]



Please remember to set this as private, or all of your data will be accessible to anyone.

*I'm grateful for my vibe coding experiences that made me somewhat familiar with GitHub, so I wouldn't have stumbled at this step.*

That way, my Obsidian vault will reflect the exact same structure as my GitHub repo.

![[Pasted image 20260211174339.png]]

And the reason why I'm doing this is that I can't use Claude Code on Obsidian (for now):

---

- VS Code + Claude Code extension
I've never downloaded VS Code in my life because of how complex the platform seemed to be.

But once I was encouraged to run Claude Code on my Mac for other vibe coding projects, it has become something I use every day.

VS Code lets you run Claude directly inside with the extension.

![[Pasted image 20260211144018.png]]

As a non-coder, I'm using the chatbox but it's perfectly fine to use the Terminal to do up your chats.

![[Pasted image 20260212113048.png]]

Another part of Claude Code that I just learnt about was Skills, which are meant to replace agents as shared by Barry Zhang and Mahesh Murag from Anthropic.

[https://x.com/barry_zyj/status/1978860549837299948](https://x.com/barry_zyj/status/1978860549837299948)

I've been building out Skills to automate the boring tasks that take me ages to complete, and all I need is to invoke a slash command (inspired by Teresa Torres' /today command).

![[Pasted image 20260211163044.png]]

*Claude Skills have not been invoked reliably by using natural language, so I decided to configure them as slash commands instead (which are more reliable).*

I'll be sharing how I built out these skills in another post, but I feel it's worth learning and iterating on how to build one out (instead of using a preset one).

*Claude's preset skill builder is comprehensive enough so you could state the task you want to complete and they'll help you out.*

---

## How I built out the system
I had a lot of files that I (thankfully) compiled in Notion, which gave me a good head start on building out my brain.

![[Pasted image 20260212113733.png]]

This could be a tedious portion of it, depending on where you store all of your documents. 

*I believe it's possible to import Word or Google doc files inside via a MCP, though you may need to build that out or experiment with the MCPs out there (I haven't touched that yet).*

So I created a GitHub repo to store all 5,050+ (and counting) files that I gathered from different sources, and used this file architecture inspired by Teresa Torres:

- Content Archive: A list of all of the published posts by Automata and my personal account, so I can use pattern recognition to surface new insights or interlink between ideas
- Context: The key source of information that gets linked through Skills. When I want to capture an idea for an article, the Skill immediately references my branding_guidelines.md to add more context about the idea based on my thought process
- Readwise: I'm using @readwise to sync my swipe files and to also highlight key points in long-form articles that I read. It's a paid subscription and all of my highlights are stored here that I can use for future articles as quotes
- Tasks: The working layer, articles are my busiest where I go through the entire flow from idea → outlining → writing → done, before moving over to the Content Archive (sort of my mini Kanban)
- Writing: A .md tracker of all the tasks that I'm doing

![[Pasted image 20260211163654.png]]

The key file inside this repo is the brain_index.md file, which routes queries to the appropriate context.

![[Pasted image 20260211164641.png]]

This helps to save tokens, and there's likely not one perfect system. I built mine out through trial and error, where if the output is not what I'd expect:

I'd let Claude know and ask it to adapt the brain_index.md file which adapts to my new commands.

*It will take time to iterate, and I doubt it's possible to get everything working immediately.*

I try to load up as much information in the Context and Content_Archive folders, which are all stored in .md files.

An example of context was how I built out libraries that included all of the transcripts and newsletters by the thought leaders and other creators that I follow.


![[Pasted image 20260211164933.png]]

At any time, I could ask Claude about how Alex Hormozi teaches me how to create an offer, and Claude will look inside that file.

![[Pasted image 20260211165455.png]]

I've also built out multiple workflows to complete certain tasks that I hate doing.

The first task I wanted to completely eradicate was summarising YouTube transcripts.

My old process involved:

- Copying the YouTube URL
- Find a YouTube to Transcript tool
- Copy the generated transcript into ChatGPT
- Use my summariser prompt to summarise it
- Read through the summary

There are times when I forget about a certain transcript, and I have to go through the entire process again, which wastes even more time.

Now, I've built a youtube-learnings skill that does both:
- Getting the transcript from a YouTube URL 
- Summarising using my prompt
- Adding more context to the thought leader's index file

All I need is to type this command,

![[Pasted image 20260211170102.png]]

and a transcript and summary will be generated in the appropriate folder, which I could query at any time.

![[Pasted image 20260211174604.png]]

*A huge amount of time is saved doing the same repetitive tasks over and over again.*

And I'm sure that you have the same tasks in your workflow. The ones you hate that you could outsource and delegate to Claude to complete for you.

So if I were to break down my entire Digital Brain into repeatable steps, it would look something like this process:

- Clone the repo in VS Code
- Initial commit: Add as many .md files with all your relevant context and get Claude to organise them into relevant folders (with approval)
- Use Claude Code to make changes to the files or create Skills
- Commit changes to GitHub
- Sync the changes to Obsidian
- Make changes on Obsidian and sync back
- Pull changes from GitHub with Claude Code

Its looks complicated on paper, but I've streamlined many tasks with this system (especially those that are easily automated).

But these 8 days have not been the smoothest, and I encountered many challenges while building it out:

---

## The lessons I learned

I stayed up till 3 or even 4am in the first few days trying to get everything to work.

Many things were failing, especially when I tried to integrate different APIs into the system.

These are some of the key takeaways that I had while building out this system:

---

- *Teach AI through reflection*

The unique part of this Claude Code-Obsidian setup is how Claude can continuously learn about how you work through our interactions.

Every single interaction will provide new insights or even preferences on what I like, such as:

- Generating titles in sentence case
- Using the YYYYMMDD format when naming files
- Tagging everything using the YAML format to better visualise them on Obsidian

Based on Teresa's video, she mentioned how she asks Claude "What did you learn about me that should go in a context file?"

Claude will internalise these preferences you have (mine created a preference.md file), so that it can be referenced in the future to know how to better serve you.

*I developed a /reflect skill that I invoke before the end of the day so as to update Claude's profile about me*

---

- *Adapt from others instead of copying*

When something works for someone, it doesn't mean that it'll work for you.

Teresa's Digital Brain had 4 main system files:

- /Context
- /Tasks
- /Journal
- /Research

If I had strictly followed her folder architecture, I would have built something that wasn't to my liking, because it didn't fit my needs.

Teresa mentioned in her podcast that "how we manage tasks is so idiosyncratic that you should build for yourself".

So I've done exactly that and took the best bits that work for me from her system, and adapted it to my use case:

- Added the Learnings folder so I can build out a Library of Experts I can reference at any time
- Splitting Context and Tasks into my work and personal domains
- Building out Skills with automation workflows

*The perfect system doesn't exist out there to build your Digital Brain. Once you understand this (like I finally have), then you'll realise that the best way is to build it out for yourself.*

---

- *Break down tasks into Atomic Skills*

This was a painful lesson for me, because I had to reshape how I structured all my Skills (and wasted a lot of time in the process).

I had 2 different workflows that required getting a YouTube transcript:

- Summarising that script and then adding both the transcript and summary to the Learnings folder
- Getting the transcript alone just to create prompts (so I get an expert's view that I can adapt into a prompt)

When I called the YouTube transcript skill, Claude got confused and didn't know which skill I was referring to.

My skills code became bloated where each skill repeated the same tasks e.g. getting the transcript from the YouTube video.

If I wanted to make any changes to the entire workflow, I had to go through every different skill and modify it, which was a painful process.

So what I learned is to avoid creating monolithic skills where it manages the entire workflow.

Instead, I should have done this:

- Break down each monolithic skill into atomic components
- Create orchestrator skills that use each Atomic Skill to create a workflow

![[Pasted image 20260211170406.png]]

I first saw the term orchestrator skill in @dabit3's post below, which I find it extremely applicable in this context.

[https://x.com/dabit3/status/2020970650916225525](https://x.com/dabit3/status/2020970650916225525)

This is similar to something that we do every day (which I'm struggling with now post-surgery):

Walking is an orchestrator skill that coordinates between multiple atomic skills:

- Balance
- Rhythm
- Muscle contraction
- Joint flexion

These same skills can be used for running or standing (different orchestrator skills).

So I've learnt when writing a skill for Claude, I would think through if it's an atomic or orchestrator skill.

If it's an orchestrator, I have to break it apart into the atomic skills, so that I can plug and play them when they're required in future workflows that I want to build.

![[Pasted image 20260212101735.png]]

## Build your system your way

> The goal of using Claude Code is to integrate your entire workflow into one repository that becomes a living replica of your mind

As shared by Teresa Torres, the ultimate goal is to type commands in your own style.

Because AI has enough relevant context about you, it is able to decipher what you want and perform the required tasks.

Here's an example of how I brain-dumped certain ideas after a shower,

![[Pasted image 20260211145531.png]]

and this was the result.

![[Pasted image 20260211150101.png]]

*Not the most perfect of examples since it failed to understand what I was trying to say.*

But even then, it's a good sign to refine my skill.md so that I don't have to teach it again in future.

![[Pasted image 20260211150305.png]]

The system won't be perfect right from the start. Even when you give as much context as possible to the AI, I doubt that you can one-shot your Digital Brain.

Instead, look to iterate and constantly reflect on the result that Claude gives you.

If it's not up to standard, let Claude know what worked and what didn't.

Based on your feedback, it will adapt and change the Skill.md file so that it works more effectively.

![[Pasted image 20260212103821.png]]

---

## It's time to build yours

In just 8 days and barely any coding experience, I've built out a system that runs almost all of my life.

![[Pasted image 20260213165630.png]]

I'm basically stuck in either VS Code or Obsidian to improve the file structure or write articles, respectively.

Whenever there's a new process that I want to do, I'll look at how it can be integrated into Claude Code through APIs, including:

- Google Tasks
- Typefully
- Notion
- MonkeyType (to train my typing)
- Google Account

There's no perfect system, and I'm sure mine will change completely over the next few months.

But the only thing I can recommend right now is to start doing.

I never knew this would be possible until I tried (and failed many times in the first few days).

And if the only thing that's holding you back is because you're scared of doing it wrong (like I was), there's really no excuse. The only way we can truly learn is by failing, and not watching another 3-hour Claude Code masterclass on YouTube.

Before you become replaceable, it's time to take action now.

*If you want to learn the exact steps on how to build out a Digital Brain on your own, I shared my full guide [here](https://nuhgid.substack.com/p/day-1-build-your-digital-brain-in).*





![[Pasted image 20260211114858.png]]

## Core Idea

I downloaded my brain into Claude Code so I never have to use another app again. The goal of building my Digital Brain is to never having to use another app again. The moment you build something that works for yourself, you'll get the sense of achievement. Reference copy prompt approach from Substack. This is about the entire Digital Brain journey - how I built it, why I built it, and what it means to have your entire workflow, knowledge, and processes living in one system that you control completely.

**The Bigger Vision:**
- Every workflow lives in markdown files
- Every process documented as Claude skills
- Every piece of knowledge organized and accessible
- AI reads my system, understands my context
- No more switching between apps
- No more copy-pasting context to ChatGPT
- No more "starting from zero" every conversation

**The Achievement:**
When you build something that works for YOUR specific context - not someone else's template, not a productivity app's structure - you get a sense of achievement that no off-the-shelf tool can give you.

## Brand Voice Reminder

**nuhgid Voice:**

- **Tone:** Authentic over polished. Conversational over formal.
- **Positioning:** Human voice for work content (not corporate)
- **Approach:** Personal insights, behind-the-scenes, learning journey
- **Technical:** Depth with accessibility, no jargon walls
- **Values:** Personal identity, irreplaceability, transformation
- **Language:** British English

**Key principles:**
- Write like a human, not a brand
- Share genuine struggles and breakthroughs
- Behind-the-scenes of building, not just polished outcomes
- Conversational exploration, not formal teaching
- It's okay to be figuring things out publicly

## Irreplaceable Angle

**How does this help people become irreplaceable?**

This connects to **personal context** and **systems thinking** as the core irreplaceable elements:
- YOUR entire workflow, documented in YOUR system
- YOUR knowledge architecture that only YOU could design
- YOUR processes automated in ways that fit YOUR thinking
- AI amplifies YOUR context, doesn't replace it
- The system you build is impossible for AI to replicate without you

AI can follow your system. AI cannot BUILD a system that perfectly fits someone else's unique context, workflows, and thinking patterns. Only you can download YOUR brain.

## Thinking Questions

**Before outlining, consider:**

1. **Structure Options:**
   - Is this the origin story? (How I got here)
   - Is this the vision piece? (Why this matters)
   - Is this the how-to? (What Digital Brain actually is)
   - Or all three woven together?

2. **The Journey vs The Destination:**
   - Start with the frustration? (Copy-pasting context to ChatGPT)
   - Start with the vision? (Never needing another app)
   - Start with a specific moment? (The breakthrough realization)
   - How much of the building journey to show?

3. **Technical Detail Balance:**
   - How much to explain about how it works?
   - Show the markdown files? The skills structure?
   - Reference the Substack "copy prompt" approach - how?
   - Make it accessible to non-coders without dumbing it down

4. **The "Achievement" Angle:**
   - Why does building for yourself feel different?
   - Contrast with using someone else's template
   - The ownership and control aspect
   - Connection to irreplaceability

5. **Differentiation:**
   - How is this different from Notion? Obsidian alone? Other systems?
   - What makes Claude Code + markdown unique?
   - Why "never use another app again" isn't hyperbole?

6. **Practical Application:**
   - Do readers need to replicate your exact system?
   - What's the principle they take away?
   - How do you make this feel achievable, not overwhelming?
   - What's the first step someone takes after reading?

7. **Voice Check:**
   - Does this sound like YOU figuring it out, not YOU teaching from on high?
   - Behind-the-scenes energy vs. guru energy?
   - Personal struggles and breakthroughs included?
   - Authentic about what worked and what didn't?

## Potential Angles to Explore

**The Before/After Contrast:**
- Before: 10 different apps, context scattered, copy-pasting to ChatGPT
- After: One system, AI reads files, everything connected
- The moment you realize you haven't opened [app] in weeks

**The Copy-Paste Hell:**
- Wasting 10 minutes setting up context every ChatGPT conversation
- Every chat starts from zero (stateless)
- AI forgets everything between sessions
- The breaking point that made you build differently

**The Building Process:**
- Started with one pain point (what was it?)
- Built first skill, then another, then another
- System emerged from solving real problems
- Vibe coding approach - no master plan upfront

**The Freedom:**
- Control your own data and workflows
- Not dependent on any company's app
- Portable across AI models and tools
- Build exactly what YOU need, no compromise

**The Achievement Feeling:**
- Pride in building something that works perfectly for you
- Ownership over your workflow
- The "I made this" satisfaction
- Confidence that comes from understanding your own system

## Target Audience

People who:
- Feel overwhelmed by too many productivity apps
- Frustrated by AI tools that don't remember context
- Want control over their workflows and data
- Interested in building systems, not just using templates
- Ready to invest time in building something that lasts
- Value ownership and customization over convenience

**Irreplaceability Test:** Could AI write this with zero personal context?
- NO - Based on YOUR actual Digital Brain building journey
- NO - Requires lived experience of the frustrations and breakthroughs
- NO - Your specific system architecture and decisions
- This is signal, not slop

## Success Criteria

This article succeeds if readers:
- [ ] Understand the vision of "downloading your brain" into a system
- [ ] See the value of building for their own context vs. using templates
- [ ] Feel inspired by the achievement aspect (not just productivity gains)

**The "Brain of Alex Hormozi" Concept:**

The goal isn't just productivity—it's creating a system where you can access your accumulated knowledge, frameworks, and decision-making processes by simply asking questions. Imagine if you had the brain of Alex Hormozi or any of the great entrepreneurs and you could pick it just by asking questions. That's what Digital Brain enables: your brain, downloaded and queryable.

## Key Insights Already Implemented

**What I've built that proves this works:**

### 1. Task Management Owns Your Data
**Teresa Torres:** "How am I ever going to get my data out of Trello... how we manage our tasks is so idiosyncratic that you should build for yourself"

**My implementation:** `/todo-new` skill with Google Tasks API integration - real-time sync, mobile access, but I control the integration. Not locked into Trello's walled garden.

### 2. "Claude, What Can You Do For Me?"
**Teresa Torres:** "Claude, what's on my to-do list that you can just do for me?"

**My implementation:**
- `/finance-statement` - Auto-extract 889 transactions from PDFs (saving hours)
- `/article-reference` - Fetch YouTube transcripts automatically
- `/core-index` - Rebuild all directory indexes across 5,050+ files
- `/typefully-sync` - Auto-sync published tweets
- Pattern: Ask "can Claude do this?" and build skills when yes

### 3. Markdown Files = Claude-Readable Context
**Teresa Torres:** "Because it's all in markdown, it makes everything I do super accessible to Claude"

**My implementation:**
- 5,050+ markdown files in `digital-brain/`
- Modular context: `Context/Business_FIP/`, `Context/Job_Automata/`, `Context/Personal/`
- Article pipeline entirely in markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Finance tracking: `expenses_master.md` (£18,683.30 across 889 transactions)
- Result: Claude reads my files, understands context, executes workflows

### 4. Context Libraries: Small, Modular Files
**Teresa Torres:** "I've created little markdown files. And the key is they're little."

**My implementation:**
- `Business_FIP/branding_master.md` - FIP voice and positioning
- `Job_Automata/brand_guide.md` - Automata technical voice
- `Personal/nuhgid_branding/work_account_nuhgid.md` - nuhgid voice
- `Workflows/_preferences_index.md` - Cross-cutting conventions
- Each context file focused on one aspect

### 5. Idiosyncratic Workflows = Competitive Advantage
**Teresa Torres:** "This is exactly the type of thing that you should build for yourself because it can work exactly the way you want it to work"

**Dan Koe:** "Your advantage is doing what only you would think to do with AI"

**My implementation:**
- 4-stage article pipeline (idea → outlining → writing → done) with category-based organisation
- Custom PDF extraction for multiple bank formats (PayLah, SC Smart, AMEX, HSBC)
- Three-brand content system (FIP, Automata, nuhgid) with different voices and archives
- Atomic + Orchestrator skill pattern
- **No one else would build this exact system** - it fits MY workflow

### 6. Obsidian + Claude Code = Life in Markdown
**Teresa Torres:** "Pretty much Claude Code and Obsidian read my life"

**My implementation:**
- Obsidian vault syncs `digital-brain/` (5,050+ files)
- Hierarchical index system with YAML linking for Obsidian graph view
- Two vaults: Main `digital-brain/` + lightweight `writing-hub/` for mobile
- Everything lives in markdown: tasks, articles, context, learnings, finances, journal

### 7. Custom Skills = Encoded Frameworks
**Dan Koe:** "Custom system prompts encoding your frameworks"

**My implementation:**
- 40+ skills in `.claude/skills/`
- `/article-koemmandments` - Dan Koe's 10 Koemmandments framework
- `/ai-write-human` - 12 AI pattern avoidance rules
- `/article-vv` - Visualise Value geometric framework
- `/prompt-generator` - Meta-prompting with verification patterns
- **My frameworks, automated**

### 8. Lazy Prompting Through Context
**Teresa Torres:** "Builds a giant context library so she can be lazy with her prompting"

**My implementation:**
- Brand voice files loaded automatically by `/article-idea`
- CLAUDE.md provides context routing and system conventions
- Skills reference context files automatically
- I don't re-explain FIP voice - it's in `branding_master.md`
- I don't re-explain article stages - it's in CLAUDE.md

### 9. Portable, Tool-Agnostic System
**Teresa Torres:** "Worried about getting data out of Trello"

**My implementation:**
- Everything in markdown (universally readable)
- Git version control (complete history, any platform)
- No proprietary formats
- Skills are Python scripts + markdown (can run anywhere)
- **Future-proof:** Works with Claude Code today, will work with any AI tomorrow

### 10. "The Brain of Alex Hormozi" Queryable System

**My implementation:**
- Context files document frameworks and decision-making
- `customer_pain_points.md` captures FIP customer insights
- `brand_guide.md` encodes Automata positioning
- `working_style.md` documents work patterns
- **I can ask Claude:**
  - "What's the FIP brand enemy?" → "The Hamster Wheel"
  - "How do I write for Automata?" → Applies Sovereign Architect voice
  - "What are my finance accounts?" → Shows 4 consolidated accounts

### What I've Built That They Haven't Shown:
- Multi-brand workflow (FIP, Automata, nuhgid)
- Finance automation across multiple bank formats
- Typefully integration with conflict detection
- Category-based article organisation
- Skill health checking (`/core-skill-health-check`)
- Reflection system (`/core-tonight`)

**The Pattern:**
1. Start with frustration (copy-pasting to ChatGPT, manual entry, scattered context)
2. Build the tool Claude can use (markdown files, Python scripts, YAML frontmatter)
3. Encode frameworks (brand voices, workflows, decision patterns)
4. Let Claude execute (skills read context, perform tasks, maintain system)
5. Iterate based on use (not upfront planning - vibe coding)

**Result:** My brain, downloaded and queryable. My workflows, automated. My context, always available.

## Key Points to Weave Into Article (Non-Coder Angle)

### Anti-Hero: The Course Collector
**Who they are:**
- Taking Python and R courses they never finish
- Watching YouTube tutorials they forget because they don't apply anything
- Spending more time researching tools than using them
- Bookmarking "Learn to Code" resources they never open

**False belief:** "I need to understand how it works before I can use it"

**Fear:** "I'll break something if I start without complete knowledge"

**Result:** Stuck in safe mode, analysis paralysis, never building anything

**Visceral moment:** They see "Claude Code is amazing" tweets, click through excited, see code examples, close the tab feeling excluded. Again.

### 1. Build for YOUR Context, Not Generic Templates

**Teresa Torres insight:** "How we manage tasks is so idiosyncratic that this is exactly the type of thing that you should build for yourself"

**Your proof (non-coder journey):**
- Didn't copy someone's "Ultimate Productivity System"
- Started with YOUR annoying task: YouTube transcript fetching (saw Carl Vellotti's script)
- Built YOUR domain system: folders for Dan Koe, Teresa Torres, specific people you learn from
- Result: Three-brand workflow (FIP, Automata, nuhgid) that no template could provide

**Article angle:** Templates fail because they're built for someone else's context. Your first automation should solve YOUR specific annoyance, not someone else's example problem.

**Questions to explore:**
- What was the moment you realised templates don't work?
- How did starting with one specific task (YouTube transcripts) lead to the full system?
- What made you choose domain folders vs. other organisation methods?

---

### 2. "Claude, What Can You Just Do For Me?"

**Teresa Torres insight:** "Claude, what's on my to-do list that you can just do for me?"

**Your proof (concrete examples):**
- `/finance-statement` - Auto-extracted 889 transactions from PDFs (hours saved, zero coding)
- `/learnings-youtube` - Drop URL → get transcript + summary + organised folder
- `/core-index` - Rebuild 5,050+ file indexes automatically
- `/typefully-sync` - Auto-sync published tweets

**Article angle:** You don't need to understand Python. You just need to identify: "What am I doing manually that's annoying?" Then ask Claude to automate it.

**The finance automation story:**
- Problem: Manually entering 889 transactions from 4 different bank PDF formats
- Solution: Asked Claude to extract them automatically
- How: Didn't write Python from scratch - used existing PDF tools, Claude adapted them
- Result: What took hours now takes seconds

**Questions to explore:**
- What was your reaction when you first automated finance statements?
- How long did it take to build vs. how long you'd been doing it manually?
- What made you think "I can automate this" instead of "this is too technical"?

---

### 3. Your Advantage = What Only YOU Would Build

**Dan Koe insight:** "Your advantage isn't doing what AI can't do...Your advantage is doing what only you would think to do with AI"

**Your proof (unique system):**
- Three-brand content system with different voices and archives (nobody else has this)
- Category-based article organisation (not chronological like everyone else)
- Domain folders for thought leaders (queryable knowledge base of their frameworks)
- Finance automation across YOUR specific bank formats (PayLah, SC Smart, AMEX, HSBC)

**Article angle:** Carl Vellotti's script was the starting point. But YOUR system (domain folders, multi-brand workflow, category organisation) came from YOUR specific needs. That's what makes it valuable - it's impossible for someone else to replicate without understanding your context.

**Questions to explore:**
- What part of your system would make no sense to anyone else?
- How did you decide on the three-brand structure?
- What made you organise articles by category vs. date?

---

### 4. Start Small, Compound Over Time

**Teresa Torres insight:** "I've created little markdown files. And the key is they're little."

**Your journey (the compound effect):**
1. **First:** Used Carl Vellotti's transcript script (just ran it, didn't understand Python)
2. **Then:** Added summary skill on top (one more automation)
3. **Then:** Created domain folders for specific people (organisation layer)
4. **Now:** Full queryable system with 40+ skills, 5,050+ files

**Article angle:** You didn't build "Digital Brain" on day one. You automated YouTube transcripts, saw it work, asked "what else?" Started small. Compounded over time. Each skill built on the previous one.

**The progression:**
- Week 1: Transcript fetcher
- Week 2: Add summaries
- Week 3: Domain folders
- Week 4: Context files
- Month 2: Finance automation
- Month 3: Article pipeline
- Now: 40+ skills

**Questions to explore:**
- What was the first skill that made you think "I can build on this"?
- How long between first automation and feeling like you had a "system"?
- What made you keep going instead of stopping at one skill?

---

### 5. Doing and Learning > Studying Then Doing

**Your insight:** "The only way to learn AI is by doing it yourself"

**The contrast:**
- **Python/R courses:** Took them, forgot everything (studied without applying)
- **Carl Vellotti's script:** Used it, remembered how it works (applied immediately)
- **Finance automation:** Built it to solve real problem, learned PDF extraction by doing
- **40+ skills:** Learned by iterating on actual pain points, not textbook examples

**Article angle:** You retain what you learn when it solves a real problem. Courses teach you Python syntax in isolation. Building your finance automation teaches you how to automate annoying tasks.

**The retention difference:**
- Course: "Here's how for loops work" → forget next week
- Real task: "I need to process 889 transactions" → remember forever because you solved it

**Questions to explore:**
- What did you retain from courses vs. what you retained from building?
- When did you realise "doing and learning" works better than courses?
- What would you tell your past self who was taking Python courses?

---

### 6. Markdown = Non-Coder Friendly

**Teresa Torres insight:** "Because it's all in markdown, it makes everything super accessible to Claude"

**Your proof (no databases, no APIs to learn):**
- 5,050+ markdown files (just text files, no proprietary formats)
- Everything queryable: "What's the FIP brand enemy?" → Claude reads `branding_master.md`
- Context files in plain text: brand voices, workflows, decision patterns
- Works with any AI: Portable across tools, future-proof

**Article angle:** Markdown is just text files. You don't need to learn databases or APIs. Write in plain text, Claude reads it. That's it.

**The simplicity:**
- Not: "Learn SQL to query your knowledge base"
- Instead: "Write markdown files, ask Claude questions"
- No setup, no configuration, just text files

**Questions to explore:**
- What made you choose markdown vs. Notion/databases?
- How does it feel to control your data in plain text?
- What happens if Claude Code disappears tomorrow? (Your markdown files still work)

---

### 7. The "Brain of Alex Hormozi" You Built

**Dan Koe concept:** "Imagine if you had the brain of Alex Hormozi...and you could pick it just by asking questions"

**Your implementation (queryable knowledge base):**
- Domain folders: Dan Koe transcripts + summaries, Teresa Torres videos, Carl Vellotti lessons
- Context files: Customer pain points, brand guides, working style, decision patterns
- Queryable system: Ask Claude about FIP voice, Automata positioning, past decisions
- Growing library: Every YouTube video, every insight, every framework captured

**Article angle:** You're building a queryable version of your brain AND the thought leaders you learn from. That's what "downloading your brain" means. You can ask: "What would Dan Koe say about this?" and get an answer based on 50+ hours of his content you've processed.

**The magic moment:**
- Before: Watch YouTube video, take notes, forget where you saved them
- After: Drop URL, get transcript + summary + organised folder, ask questions months later

**Questions to explore:**
- When did you first ask Claude a question and it pulled from your domain folders?
- What's the most surprising insight you've extracted from your knowledge base?
- How does it feel to have a queryable version of thought leaders' frameworks?

---

### 8. Concrete First Automation: Finance Statements

**The proof non-coders need (detailed breakdown):**

**Problem:** Manually entering 889 transactions from 4 different bank PDF formats (PayLah, SC Smart, AMEX, HSBC)

**What you did (no coding background):**
1. Asked Claude: "Can you extract transactions from these PDFs?"
2. Claude: "Yes, using pdfplumber library"
3. You: "I don't know Python, can you build this?"
4. Claude: Built the script
5. You: Ran it, worked on first try for PayLah
6. Then: "What about SC Smart format?" → Claude adapted it
7. Then: "What about AMEX?" → Claude added that format
8. Now: Drop any PDF, get extracted transactions

**Result:** What took hours (manual entry, checking, reconciling) now takes seconds (run script, review, done)

**The learning:** You learned PDF extraction, Python libraries, data formatting—not from a course, but from solving one specific problem.

**Article angle:** This is the "one annoying task" example. Show the before/after. Show that you didn't need to learn Python first—you just needed to solve the problem, and Claude taught you along the way.

**Questions to explore:**
- What was your reaction when it worked the first time?
- How many hours had you spent doing this manually before automating?
- What made you think "I can automate this" vs. "I'll just keep doing it manually"?

---

### 9. The "Doing and Learning" Formula

**Pattern that emerges from your journey:**

1. **Find annoying task** (YouTube transcripts, finance entry, article organisation)
2. **Search: "Has someone solved this?"** (Carl Vellotti's script, PDF extraction tools, Obsidian examples)
3. **Use it** (even if you don't understand the code—just run it)
4. **Ask: "What else can I add?"** (summaries, domain folders, automation layers)
5. **Iterate based on YOUR needs** (not tutorials, YOUR workflow, YOUR pain points)

**Article angle:** This is the playbook for non-coders. Not "Learn Python first." Just: Find task → Find tool → Use it → Build on it → Iterate.

**The compound effect:**
- Skill 1: Transcript fetcher (borrowed from Carl)
- Skill 2: Summary generator (built on top)
- Skill 3: Domain organiser (added organisation)
- Skill 4: Finance automation (new pain point)
- Skill 5-40: Keep solving problems, keep building

**Questions to explore:**
- At what point did you stop looking for tutorials and start just building?
- How did your confidence change from skill 1 to skill 40?
- What's the pattern you follow now when you hit a new annoying task?

---

### 10. The Shift: From Consumer to Builder

**Before (Course Collector):**
- "I need to learn Python before I can automate anything"
- "I should take a course on AI first"
- "I'll start building once I understand how it works"
- Bookmarking resources, never applying them
- Stuck in tutorial hell, analysis paralysis

**After (Builder):**
- "I have an annoying task, can I automate it?"
- "I'll use this tool even if I don't understand how it works"
- "What else can I add to make this better?"
- Building first, understanding comes through iteration
- Learning by doing, not studying then doing

**The unlock:** Realising you don't need to understand how Python works to use a Python script. You don't need to master APIs to call them. You just need to solve one annoying task.

**The permission:** It's okay to use tools you don't fully understand. It's okay to start without complete knowledge. It's okay to learn by failing at something specific.

**Article angle:** This is the mindset shift. The article should take readers from "I need to learn first" to "I can start now with one task."

**Questions to explore:**
- What was the exact moment you shifted from consumer to builder?
- What gave you permission to use tools you didn't fully understand?
- What would you tell someone stuck in "course collector" mode?

## Key Quotes to Feature

**Teresa Torres (about building for yourself):**
> "How we manage our tasks is so idiosyncratic that this is exactly the type of thing that you should build for yourself because it can work exactly the way you want it to work which is part of the magic."

**Dan Koe (about AI advantage):**
> "Your advantage isn't doing what AI can't do...Your advantage is doing what only you would think to do with AI"

**Your insight (non-coder perspective):**
> "I took Python courses I never finished. But when I had one annoying task—grabbing YouTube transcripts—I found Carl Vellotti's script and just used it. That's when I actually learned. Not from courses. From doing."

**Carl Vellotti (inspiration moment):**
Reference his video where you first saw the transcript script: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nthc76rSl8&t=5595s

## Article Structure Notes (Advanced Framework)

### Section 1: Perspective (They're Wrong)
**Common belief:** "Non-coders need to learn Python/APIs/fundamentals before they can use AI automation tools"

**Why it's wrong:** This keeps you stuck in course collector mode. You learn by doing, not by studying first.

**Your proof:** You have zero coding background, yet built 40+ skills by just starting with one annoying task.

### Section 2: Advantage (Your Unique Angle)
**Your advantage:** You built a system that fits YOUR three-brand workflow, YOUR specific pain points, YOUR thought leader library

**Why templates fail:** They're built for someone else's context. Your first automation should solve YOUR specific problem.

**The compound effect:** Start with one task, build on it, iterate based on YOUR needs.

### Section 3: Gamify (Make It Fun)
**The game:** How many annoying tasks can you eliminate?

**First win:** Finance statements (889 transactions automated)

**Next level:** YouTube transcripts → summaries → domain folders → queryable knowledge base

**Endgame:** Your brain, downloaded and queryable. Your workflows, fully automated.
